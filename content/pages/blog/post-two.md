It is 2023, and robotic baristas are beginning to fill the role of the friendly face serving consumers their morning coffee. Algorithms and artificial intelligence recommend us new products, playlists, and services; we have come to rely on these powerful computers that fit in our pockets. As humans continue to invent ways to make life more convenient, technological assistants are becoming routine.  Many popular AI interfaces such as Siri and Alexa, as well as physical robots like Zora are designed with anthropomorphic cues to mimic human interactions. Whether intentionally for comfortability, or unintentional, anthropomorphism greatly influences the way researchers and engineers design robots. By centering human-like qualities such as bipedalism, complex language use, and human social cues as “best," developers overlook the opportunity to build a new kind of relationship with robotic and virtual assistants.

Humanoid social robots, or HSRs, are man-made machines that “learn” from a given data set, appear in physical and virtual forms, and are designed to interact with and mimic humans to various degrees. By definition, describing a robot as humanoid in its appearance cues implies that the robot is designed to be perceived similarly to people. Robots of today can demonstrate form anthropomorphism via sensory cues like voice and/or physical appearance, but even the most advanced are distinguishable from their human counterparts due to a lack of behavioral anthropomorphism. Humans are capable of generating hundreds of thousands of nonverbal behaviors and expressions, a range beyond technology’s current capabilities… but the future is coming, and what then? As humanity continues to integrate technology into nearly every aspect of our lives, research is necessary to inform fabrication and marketing decisions.
